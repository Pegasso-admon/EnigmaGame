                <p class="level__description">Few dared to take this door.</p>
                <p class="level__description">A skull, carved in blood, warned us away.</p>
                <p class="level__description">But what if it was a trick?</p>
                <p class="level__description">We stepped through... and the world changed.</p>
                <p class="level__description">The room dissolved.</p>
                <p class="level__description">We floated in an artificial realm — endless lines of code, distorted colors.</p>

                <p class="level__description">We were thrown into illusions:</p>
                <p class="level__description">Loved ones screaming for help. Paths that looked like freedom. Teammates begging to go back.</p>
                <p class="level__description">Every emotional choice had a real-world cost — a collar beeping louder, tightening slightly.</p>
                <p class="level__description">Only when we recognized the illusion, refusing to play its game, the simulation glitch and a binary code appeared in front of us begging to be solved.</p>
                <p class="level__description">you must translate the following binary code to write the answer</p>
                <p class="level__description">01100011 01101001 01100011 01100001 01100100 01100001 00110011 00110011 00110000 00110001</p>
