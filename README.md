the option selected by the player, they are redirected to a corresponding page. Each challenge includes the possibility
of failure, which results in the end of the game.

## What we learned

```
We put into practice key JavaScript concepts such as manipulation of the DOM, the use of conditionals, and various control
structures to manage game logic and user interaction. Additionally, this project allowed us to reinforce and deepen our
understanding of the concepts introduced in the previous module, including the structure and styling of web pages using HTML
and CSS. This integration of front-end technologies was essential to develop an interactive and visually coherent user experience.
